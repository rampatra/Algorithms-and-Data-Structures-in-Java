     * - If A does not know B, then B can’t be celebrity. Discard B, but A may be celebrity.
     * - Repeat above two steps till we left with only one person.
     * Find celebrity within remaining persons by performing the below operations:
     * - Push all the celebrities into a stack.
     * - Pop off top two persons from the stack, discard one person based on return status of HaveAcquaintance(A, B).
     * - Push the remained person onto stack.
     * - Repeat step 2 and 3 until only one person remains in the stack.
     * - Check the remained person in stack does not have acquaintance with anyone else.
