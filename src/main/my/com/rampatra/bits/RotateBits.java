 * A ROTATION (OR CIRCULAR SHIFT) is an operation similar to
 * shift except that the bits that fall off at one end are put
 * back to the other end.
 * <p/>
 * For example, 000â€¦11100101 becomes 00..0011100101000 if the number
 * is rotated 3 times towards left and becomes 101000..0011100 if the
 * number is rotated 3 times towards right.
