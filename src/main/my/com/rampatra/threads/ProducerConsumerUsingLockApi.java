/**
 * Problem Description: A simple Producer/Consumer using the Lock and Condition Api pattern. For the language primitive,
 * i.e, synchronize and wait/notify pattern, please see {@link ProducerConsumerUsingWaitNotify}.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * There are a few advantages of going with the Lock Api pattern instead of the language primitive synchronize and
 * wait/notify pattern:
 * <p>
 * - Can be interrupted which means that the application won't continue to run forever in weird situations. Consider this
 * example, what happens if the Consumer starts first and there are no elements to consume and the Producer also fails
 * due to some exception. In wait/notify the Consumer would stall forever. You would have to restart the JVM to get
 * rid of this. However, with Lock api, you can use {@link Lock#lockInterruptibly()}.
 * <p>
 * - Timed lock acquisition. You can try to acquire a lock and if it is not instantly available then do something else.
 * See {@link Lock#tryLock()} to learn more. You can also wait for a certain amount of time before giving up with the
 * {@link Lock#tryLock(long, TimeUnit)} method. This isn't possible with the primitive pattern.
 * <p>
 * - A fair Lock generates a fair Condition. Fair here means the first thread in the waiting queue will be picked first
 * by the scheduler. This is a costly operation so use it only when necessary.
