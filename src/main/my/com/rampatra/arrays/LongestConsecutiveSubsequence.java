     * Given an array of distinct integers, find the length of the longest sub-sequence such that
     * elements in the subsequence are consecutive integers, the consecutive numbers can be in any order.
     * <p>
     * Examples:
     * Input: arr[] = {1, 9, 3, 10, 4, 20, 2};
     * Output: 4
     * The subsequence {1, 3, 4, 2} is the longest subsequence
     * of consecutive elements
     * <p>
     * Input: arr[] = {36, 41, 56, 35, 44, 33, 34, 92, 43, 32, 42}
     * Output: 5
     * The subsequence {36, 35, 33, 34, 32} is the longest subsequence
     * of consecutive elements.
     * <p>
     * NOTE: You can also sort this array and check for consecutive elements. You can take this approach if interviewer
     * asks to solve with no additional space but do bear in mind that some sorting algorithms do require extra space.
     *
     * @param arr unsorted array of non-repeating integers
     * @return the length of the longest consecutive subsequence
