     * Construct a Product Array prod[] (of same size) such that prod[i] is
     * equal to the product of all the elements of arr[] except arr[i]. Solve
     * it without division operator and in O(n).
     * <p/>
     * You can do this by taking two arrays one containing the products from
     * left to right elements and other containing the products from right to
     * left elements and then finally multiplying those two arrays gives you
     * the answer. But the auxiliary space complexity of this method is O(n)
     * as well as the space complexity is O(n).
     * <p/>
     * The below method is the optimized way to do this in O(1) auxiliary space
     * but the space complexity is O(n).
     * <p/>
     * AUXILIARY SPACE is extra space or temporary space used by the algorithm,
     * which is mostly used in algorithm where we use swapping or temporary variables.
     * <p/>
     * SPACE COMPLEXITY means total space taken by the algorithm with respect to
     * input size.Space complexity calculated by both auxiliary space and space used
     * by the input.
     * <p/>
     * For example - If we want to compare standard sorting algorithm on the basis of
     * then auxiliary space would be better criteria than space complexity. Merge sort
     * uses O(n) auxiliary space,where Insertion sort and Heap sort uses O(1) auxiliary
     * space. Merge sort requires Î©(n) but Heap sort requires only a constant amount.
     * Space complexity of all these sorting algorithm is O(n) though.
