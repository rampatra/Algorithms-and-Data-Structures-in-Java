/**
 * Level: Easy
 * Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-word-distance-iii/
 * Problem Description:
 * This is a follow-up problem of {@link ShortestWordDistance}. The only difference is that now word1 could be the
 * same as word2.
 * <p>
 * Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.
 * word1 and word2 may be the same and they represent two individual words in the list.
 * <p>
 * For example,
 * Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].
 * Given word1 = “makes”, word2 = “coding”, return 1.
 * Given word1 = "makes", word2 = "makes", return 3.
 * <p>
 * Note: You may assume word1 and word2 are both in the list. If they are same then it's guaranteed that there are
 * two occurrences of the same.
