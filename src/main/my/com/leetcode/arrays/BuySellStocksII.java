 * Description:
 * Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
 * <p>
 * Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you
 * like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).
 * <p>
 * Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock
 * before you buy again).

     * we skip one of the peaks (trying to obtain more profit), we will end up losing the profit over one of the

     * This solution follows the logic used in the above approach {@link #maxProfit(int[])}, but with only a slight
     * variation. In this case, instead of looking for every peak following a valley, we can simply go on crawling over
     * the slope and keep on adding the profit obtained from every consecutive transaction.
     * In the end, we will be using the peaks and valleys effectively, but we need not track the costs corresponding to
     * the peaks and valleys along with the maximum profit, but we can directly keep on adding the difference between the
     * consecutive numbers of the array if the second number is larger than the first one, and at the total sum we obtain
     * will be the maximum profit. This approach will simplify the solution.
