/**
 * Level: Medium
 * Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-celebrity/
 * Problem Description:
 * Suppose you are at a party with n people (labeled from 0 to n - 1) and among them, there may exist one celebrity.
 * The definition of a celebrity is that all the other n - 1 people know him/her but he/she does not know any of them.
 *
 * Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one. The only thing you are allowed to do
 * is to ask questions like: "Hi, A. Do you know B?" to get information of whether A knows B. You need to find out the
 * celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).
 *
 * You are given a helper function bool knows(a, b) which tells you whether A knows B. Implement a
 * function int findCelebrity(n). There will be exactly one celebrity if he/she is in the party. Return the celebrity's
 * label if there is a celebrity in the party. If there is no celebrity, return -1.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: graph = [
 *   [1,1,0],
 *   [0,1,0],
 *   [1,1,1]
 * ]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: There are three persons labeled with 0, 1 and 2. graph[i][j] = 1 means person i knows person j, otherwise
 * graph[i][j] = 0 means person i does not know person j. The celebrity is the person labeled as 1 because both 0 and 2
 * know him but 1 does not know anybody.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: graph = [
 *   [1,0,1],
 *   [1,1,0],
 *   [0,1,1]
 * ]
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: There is no celebrity.
 *
 *
 * Note: The directed graph is represented as an adjacency matrix, which is an n x n matrix where a[i][j] = 1 means
 * person i knows person j while a[i][j] = 0 means the contrary. Remember that you won't have direct access to the
 * adjacency matrix.
