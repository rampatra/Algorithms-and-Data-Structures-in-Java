/**
 * Level: Medium
 * Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hit-counter/
 * Problem Description:
 * Design a hit counter which counts the number of hits received in the past 5 minutes.
 *
 * Each function accepts a timestamp parameter (in seconds granularity) and you may assume that calls are being made
 * to the system in chronological order (ie, the timestamp is monotonically increasing). You may assume that the
 * earliest timestamp starts at 1.
 *
 * It is possible that several hits arrive roughly at the same time.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * HitCounter counter = new HitCounter();
 *
 * // hit at timestamp 1.
 * counter.hit(1);
 *
 * // hit at timestamp 2.
 * counter.hit(2);
 *
 * // hit at timestamp 3.
 * counter.hit(3);
 *
 * // get hits at timestamp 4, should return 3.
 * counter.getHits(4);
 *
 * // hit at timestamp 300.
 * counter.hit(300);
 *
 * // get hits at timestamp 300, should return 4.
 * counter.getHits(300);
 *
 * // get hits at timestamp 301, should return 3.
 * counter.getHits(301);
 *
 * Follow up:
 * What if the number of hits per second could be very large? Does your design scale?
 *
 * Runtime: <a href="https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/248917167/">42 ms</a> (better than ~98%).
