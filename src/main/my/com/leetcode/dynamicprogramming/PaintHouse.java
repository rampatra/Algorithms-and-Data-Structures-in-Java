/**
 * Level: Easy
 * Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/paint-house/
 * Problem Description:
 * There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green. The cost
 * of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent
 * houses have the same color. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix.
 * <p>
 * For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color red; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting
 * house 1 with color green, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.
 * <p>
