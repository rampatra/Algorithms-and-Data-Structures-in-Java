/**
 * Level: Hard
 * Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/paint-house-ii/
 * Problem Description:
 * There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the m colors.
 * The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different.
 * You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.
 * <p>
 * The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x m cost matrix.
 * <p>
 * For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color 0;
 * costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color 2, and so on...
 * Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.
 * <p>
 * Note: All costs are positive integers.
 * <p>
 * Follow up: Could you solve it in O(n * m) runtime? // TODO
 *
 * Companies: LinkedIn.
 * Related: {@link PaintHouse}.

     * The approach is similar to {@link PaintHouse} but slightly complex as the number of colors are arbitrary
     * instead of the 3 fixed colors. So, we use two additional for loops to cycle through all the colors.
     * Time Complexity: O(n * m * m)
     * Space Complexity: O(1)
     *
     * @param costs the costs of coloring the house, each row represents the cost of coloring a particular
     *              house with different colors
     * @return the minimum cost to paint all houses such that no two adjacent houses are of same color
