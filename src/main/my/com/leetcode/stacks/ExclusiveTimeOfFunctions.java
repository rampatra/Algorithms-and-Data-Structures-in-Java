/**
 * Level: Medium
 * Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/exclusive-time-of-functions/
 * Description:
 * On a single threaded CPU, we execute some functions.  Each function has a unique id between 0 and N-1.
 *
 * We store logs in timestamp order that describe when a function is entered or exited.
 *
 * Each log is a string with this format: "{function_id}:{"start" | "end"}:{timestamp}".  For example, "0:start:3"
 * means the function with id 0 started at the beginning of timestamp 3.  "1:end:2" means the function with id 1 ended
 * at the end of timestamp 2.
 *
 * A function's exclusive time is the number of units of time spent in this function.  Note that this does not include
 * any recursive calls to child functions.
 *
 * The CPU is single threaded which means that only one function is being executed at a given time unit.
 *
 * Return the exclusive time of each function, sorted by their function id.
 *
 * Input:
 * n = 2
 * logs = ["0:start:0","1:start:2","1:end:5","0:end:6"]
 * Output: [3, 4]
 * Explanation:
 * Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 units of time and reaches the end of time 1.
 * Now function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes 4 units of time and ends at time 5.
 * Function 0 is running again at the beginning of time 6, and also ends at the end of time 6, thus executing for 1 unit of time.
 * So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.
 *
 *
 * Note:
 * -> 1 <= n <= 100
 * -> Two functions won't start or end at the same time.
 * -> Functions will always log when they exit.
