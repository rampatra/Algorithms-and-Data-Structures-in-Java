     * You have an integer and you can flip exactly one bit from a O to a 1. Write code to find the length of the
     * longest sequence of 1s you could create.
     * Example:
     * Input: 1775 (or: 11011101111)
     * Output: 8
     * <p>
     * Approach:
     * We just walk through the integer tracking the current 1s sequence length and the previous 1s sequence length.
     * When we see a zero, update previous length as follows:
     * - If the next bit is a 1, previous Length should be set to current Length.
     * - If the next bit is a 0, then we can't merge these sequences together. So, set previous Length to 0.
     *
     * @param n an integer
     * @return the longest sequence of set bits in {@code n} by flipping only one zero bit
