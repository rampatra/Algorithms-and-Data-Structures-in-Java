     * A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes, allowing eight consecutive pixels to be stored
     * in one byte. The screen has width w, where w is divisible by 8 (that is, no byte will be split across rows).
     * The height of the screen, of course, can be derived from the length of the array and the width. Implement a
     * function that draws a horizontal line from (xl, y) to ( x2, y).
     * <p>
     * The method signature should look something like:
     * {@code drawline(byte[] screen, int width, int xl, int x2, int y)}
     * <p>
     * Approach:
     * First, find the numbers in which all bits has to be set. Next, find the starting number and apply the mask
     * created from the starting offset. Do the same with the ending number.
     *

            Consider the below screen with width 32 as an example:
            
            byte[] screen = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12};
            
            This screen has a width of 32 so you can assume the screen would be looking like:
            
                9 10 11 12
                5  6  7  8
                1  2  3  4
                
            x-axis is 5-20 (5th position to 20th position)
            y-axis is 1
            
            which means our line would lie in numbers 5, 6, and 7
            
            so if you visualize these numbers in bits, it would be like:
            
            00000101 00000110 00000111
                 ^                ^ 
            and after drawing the line, the bits would become:
            
            00000111 11111111 11111111
            
            and in the output we would see:
            
            7, -1, -1 instead of 5, 6, 7
